        "## What is the task?\n",
        "\n",
        "Medical professionals regularly have to assess their patients' well-being, and predict how they will react to certain treatments. Predicting patients' health is thus an important tool, and one for which we as NLP engineers we can be helpful. Given adequate and regularly structured Electronic Health Records (EHR), we can model patients' longterm behaviour based on their past medical records.\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem has many technical caveats, however. For instance, EHRs are generally not easy to gain access to, given privacy rules. Furthermore, once obtained, data availability and structure of EHRs can vary greatly between organisations. Hence, inter-organisational patient modelling is generally impossible.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question**: Give three further examples of potential inconsistencies in EHRs that prohibit inter-organisational patient modelling\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Standardization and Format Variability:**\n",
        "   - **Example:** Differences in coding systems and data representation between organizations hinder the seamless integration and analysis of EHRs for patient modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Incomplete or Missing Data:**\n",
        "   - **Example:** Gaps in patient medical history records, such as missing information about diagnoses or treatments, due to variations in data entry practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Differences in Data Quality and Accuracy:**\n",
        "   - **Example:** Varied levels of data validation and documentation practices among healthcare providers lead to discrepancies in the quality and accuracy of recorded data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even within a single organisation operating under the same privacy rules, modeling patient trajectories can be made more difficult because of differences between record-keeping styles of different departments and doctors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question**: Give two examples of scenarios, one involving discrete EHRs, one involving text-based EHRs, in which intra-orgasanitional patient trajectory modelling can be challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**:\n",
        "Discrete EHRs:\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenge: Different departments in a hospital use separate electronic systems, leading to difficulties in integrating patient data due to varied data standards and terminologies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text-Based EHRs:\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenge: Healthcare professionals rely on free-text notes, causing challenges in patient trajectory modeling due to diverse writing styles, lack of standardization, and the need for advanced text mining techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "(END OF ANSWER)\n",
        "\n",
        "However, that doesn't mean that the problem isn't tractable for some cases. Given some assumptions about the scope of the problem and the data available, we can perform some patient trajectory prediction. For this, we use the MIMIC-III dataset, to which you should all have access now. It is available [here](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/). However, to get a start, feel free to use the smaller, publicly available [demo version](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/) (though it has no textual records). For the text portion, I recommend taking only a random subset of patients and uploading a smaller text file to colab, unless you have a very fast internet connection or don't mind waiting around. (You can also upload it to Google Drive and re-mount it each time if you plan on working in multiple sittings to save bandwidth).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this module, we will predict patient morbidity upon hospital entry. While this is a dark task, it represents a real problem that might be modeled by clinical NLP engineers."

The Reason why I used it is that it's integration into the training loop aims to enhance the model's understanding of patient cases by incorporating specific procedural information. This dataset provides valuable insights into medical interventions, surgeries, and procedures during hospitalization, complementing the textual information in 'adm_aug.' This addition contributes to a more comprehensive patient representation, offering a holistic view of healthcare interventions. The inclusion of procedural data is motivated by its clinical relevance and the informative features captured by associated ICD codes.\n",

        "Theoretically, we can employ following strategies to improve model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model Architecture Tuning:** Experimenting with more complex neural network architectures or fine-tuning existing ones may enhance the model's ability to capture intricate patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and weight decay can have a significant impact on training dynamics and model convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Augmentation:** Applying diverse data augmentation techniques to increase the variability in the training data might enhance the model's robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Ensemble Learning:** Combining predictions from multiple models or model snapshots during training (ensemble learning) can often lead to improved generalization performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Text Preprocessing:** Fine-tuning text preprocessing steps, such as handling stop words, stemming, or adjusting the maximum text length, could impact the model's ability to extract meaningful information from the medical notes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Advanced Embeddings:** Exploring embeddings other than BERT, such as domain-specific embeddings or embeddings trained on larger and more diverse corpora, could potentially provide better contextual representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **More Data:** Increasing the size of the training dataset, if feasible, could allow the model to learn more complex relationships within the data.\n",
